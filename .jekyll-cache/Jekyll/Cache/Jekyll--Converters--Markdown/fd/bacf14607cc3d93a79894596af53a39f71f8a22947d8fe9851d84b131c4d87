<h3 id="schema">Schema</h3>

<p>Schema-on-write: schema is well-defined when writing data into storage.</p>

<p>Schema-on-read: schema is defined when reading data for analysis.</p>

<h3 id="first-generation">First-generation</h3>

<p>It coupled compute and storage into an on-premises appliance, and enterprises have to pay for it.</p>

<p>Datasets are becoming unstructured, video, audio, and texts. The data warehouse cannot store and query them.</p>

<h3 id="second-generation">Second generation</h3>

<h2 id="lakehouse">LakeHouse</h2>

<p>The paper shows LakeHouse has the following advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Based on open direct-access data formats, like Parquet, ORC,</li>
  <li>First-class support for ML</li>
  <li>Offers state-of-art performance.</li>
</ol>

<p>It can address several challenges: data staleness, reliability, the total cost of ownership, data lock-in, and limited use-case support.</p>

<p>The paper shows that LakeHouse is competitive with cloud data warehouses on TPC-DS</p>
