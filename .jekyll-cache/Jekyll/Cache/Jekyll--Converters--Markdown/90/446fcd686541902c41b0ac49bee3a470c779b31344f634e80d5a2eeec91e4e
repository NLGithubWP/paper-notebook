<p>The paper introduces the NAS-Bench-201, which is extended from NAS-Bench-101.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Previously NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-HPO-Bench are proposed. However,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>some NAS algorithms can not be applied directly on NASBench-101.</p>

    <p>101 has constraints on the nodes/edges of each cell. Some NAS algorithms based on weight-sharing cannot be applied into it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NAS-HPO-Bench only has 144 candidate architectures, which may be insufficient to evaluate NAS algorithms.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

<p>In summary, the paper makes the following contributions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The search space: Cell-based, each cell has <strong>4 nodes and 5 operations</strong>, which results in 15625 cell/architectures candidates in total.</li>
  <li>Each architecture is trained on three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-16-120 ), and the paper records their loss, accuracy, number of parameters, and FLOPs.</li>
  <li>The paper benchmarked <strong>10 NAS algorithms</strong> on the above search space.</li>
</ol>
