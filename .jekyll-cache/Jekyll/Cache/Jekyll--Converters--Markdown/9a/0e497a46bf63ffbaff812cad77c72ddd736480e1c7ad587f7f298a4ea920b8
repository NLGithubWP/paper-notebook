<p>Cohort analysis processing is a data analysis technique for assessing the effects of aging on human behavior in a changing society. But it is hard to implement in traditional DBMS</p>

<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define cohort analytics problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introduce the extended relation to model user data for cohort analytics, and introduce three new operators for it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Two of them can extract a subset of activities.</li>
      <li>The last one can aggregate over arbitrary attribute combinations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build a columnar-based cohort query engine with many optimizations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design benchmark study.</p>

<p>Activate table has a primary key constraint on (Au; At; Ae). And many attributes.  User (Au), timestamp (At), and action (Ae) attribute</p>

<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts</h2>

<p>birth action: Action e</p>

<p>birth time: First-time user performs e</p>

<p>age: Age is a certain time unit such as a day, week, or month.</p>
