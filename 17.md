AI Technical Considerations Data Storage, Cloud usage and AI Pipeline

# Introduction

Four essential technique that can help drive AI application forward are **data storage, cloud usage, AI pipeline implementation and computation strategy.**

# Data Storage

Biobank is an â€œOrganised database of `medical images` and `associated imaging biomarkers (radiology and beyond) shared` among multiple researchers and linked to other bio-repositories".

THe BioBank dataset can be used in Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) system:

Challenges and considerations of data:

1. Label group truth.
2. The metadata of dataset (provenance etc) is also important.



# Cloud Usage

## Characteristics

On-demand self-service: user can deploy self-defined services and they can automatically expend.

Resource polling: cloud provider can dynamically assign or schedule resources to multiple customers

Repid elasticity: ability of on-demand auto-scaling.

## Service Model

Cloud can provide services like PaaS, MLaaS, IaaS etc. 

## Deployment Model

Private cloud: Exclusive cloud for one organization.

Community cloud: the use is not exclusive to one organization but to multiple organizations.

Public cloud: open to public.



# AI PipeLine

Support whole process form data collection to deployment.









# Distributed/Federated Learning
