Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of Distributed Systems

# Introduction

## Background

### The global-state-detection algorithm

Processesdo not share clocks or memory, we need to design `global-state-detection` algorithm such that each process can form a global system state with their own recored states and states of communication channels.

The `global-state-detection` algorithm should has following properties:

1. It must run at background concurrently with, but not disturb, this underlying computation.
2. The snapshots cannot all be taken at precisely the same instant because of synchronization problems.
3. Snapshot must be meaningful.

### Why is it important?

`stable property`: The predicate `y is said to be a stable property` of D if y(S) implies y(S’) for all global states S’ of D reachable from global state S of D.

Serveral distributes system problems => problem of find an `global-state-detection` algorithm and process can use it to determine whether system holds a `stable property`. 

For example, 

1. In deadlock problem => detect a`stable property` (it can be "The system is deadlocked"), and some `global-state-detection`(deadlock-detection algorithm) can detect such state, and solve the problem accordingly.
2. For multiple phase distributed algorithms => detect a `stable property` so that one phase can be terminated and the next phase initiated, and `global-state-detection `can do that.

### Current problems

Many `global-state-detection` algorithms (eg,. sloving deadlock problems ) are incorrect and impractical because the relationships among `local process states, global system states, and points in a distributed computation` are not well understood.

### Contribution

1. Define these relationships between `local process states, global system states, and points in a distributed computation`
2. Propose an algorithm by which a process in a distributed system can determines a global state (restrict attention to the problem of detecting stable properties) of the system during computation.

# Model of a distributed system

A distributed system consists of a `finite set of processes` and a `finite set of channels.`

A global state of a distributed system is a set of component process and channel states:

## Assumption

1. Channels have infinite buffers. Error-free, Deliver msgs in order sent.
2. Delay of message in channel is finite.

## Model

`Process p`:  defined by a set of states.

`Event e`: 5-tuples, <p, s, s', M, c> , c and M can be null if c channels doesn't change. 

- p: process where the e happens
- s: state before e happen
- s': state after e happen
- c: channel state altered by e
- M: message sent from c.

`Global state`: 

- Initial state: each process is at initial state, and channel is empty sequence. 
- State transimit on event e: s' = Next(s, e)
