Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of Distributed Systems

# Introduction

## Background

### The global-state-detection algorithm

Processesdo not share clocks or memory, we need to design `global-state-detection` algorithm such that each process can form a global system state with their own recored states and states of communication channels.

The `global-state-detection` algorithm should has following properties:

1. It must run at background concurrently with, but not disturb, this underlying computation.
2. The snapshots cannot all be taken at precisely the same instant because of synchronization problems.
3. Snapshot must be meaningful.

### Why is it important?

`stable property`: If y is table property and y(s) = true on state s, then for state s' reachable from s, y(s') = true. 

Serveral distributes system problems => problem of find an algorithm and process can use it to determine whether system holds a `stable property`. 

The `global-state-detection` algorithm can be used to determine `stable property` of system. 

For example, 

1. In deadlock problem => detect a`stable property` (it can be "The system is deadlocked"), and some `global-state-detection`(deadlock-detection algorithm) can detect such state, and solve the problem accordingly.
2. For multiple phase distributed algorithms => detect a `stable property` so that one phase can be terminated and the next phase initiated, and `global-state-detection `can do that.

### Current problems

Several algorithms for sloving deadlock problems by determining global-state has published, but many of them are incorrect and impractical because the relationships among `local process states, global system states, and points in a distributed computation` are not well understood.

### Contribution

1. Define these relationships between `local process states, global system states, and points in a distributed computation`
2. Propose an algorithm by which a process in a distributed system can determines a global state of the system during computation.
