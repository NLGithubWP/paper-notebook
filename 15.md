Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of Distributed Systems

# Introduction

## Problems

## 

Many problems in distributed system can be cast in terms of the `problem of detecting global states`. 

eg,. stable property detection: (once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter).

global state decection can be used for checkpointing. 

Since multiple process cannot share same clock and memory, the problem is to devise algorithms by which processes record their own states and the states of communication channels so that the `set of process` and `channel states recorded` `form a global system state`

## Solution

`This paper propose an algorithm by which a process in a distributed system can determines a global state of the system during computation.`
