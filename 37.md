ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems

# Introduction

## Motivation

Large-scale distributed applications require different forms of coordination, eg. configuration.

Zookeeper is a replicated service for coordinating processes of distributed applications, like distributed lock services, and shared registers. etc. 

1. Many current cloud services provide servers for **specific primitives**, eg. Queue services focus on queuing. It limits a fixed set of primitives. 

   While the zookeeper moves away from it but exposes API which enables application developers to **implement their own primitives.** It allows multiple forms of coordination. 

2. **Blocking primitives** for coordination service can cause the slow client to impact negatively the performance of faster clients. and the coordination system is complicated if the request depends on others' responses. 

   Zookeepers use **wait-free data objects** organized hierarchically as in file systems. 

## Features

1. It has **wait-free aspects of shared registers** with an **event-driven mechanism** ( like cache invalidations of the distributed file system. )
2. **Linearizability** for all requests that change zookeeper state.
3. ZooKeeper can handle 10k~100K of transactions per second
