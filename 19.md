[JMLR-2019] Neural Architecture Search: A Survey

# Introduction

The paper categorize methods for NAS according to three dimensions: `Search space, Search strategy and Performance estimation strategy.`

`search space`

Incorporating prior knowledge about architecture and task can reduce the search space, but introduce human bias. 

`search strategy`:

- Goal1: Find well-performing architectures as quickly as possible.
- Goal2: Avoid convergence to a region of suboptimal architectures.

`Performance Estimation Strategy`

- Goal1: Find architectures that achieve high predictive performance on validation dataset.
- Goal2: Reduce as much evaluation cost as possible

# Search Space

## Chain-structured Neural Networks

layer l0's output is l1's input.

search space is parameterized by 

1. number of layers n
2. type or operations very layer execution, eg., pooling, convolution, etc
3. Hyperparameters of each layer
4. number of fully-connected networks. 

## multi-branch networks

input of layer i can be formally described as a function G() combining previous layer outputs

## Block/cell-based networks

Two kinds of cells: Normal cells that preserve dimensionality of input and reduction cell reduce spatial dimension.

Final architecture is built by stacking cells in `predified manner`.

Advantages:

1. Search space is redued because cell has less layers.
2. Architecture built from cells can more easily be transferred or adapted to other dataset. 
3. Creating architecture by repeating blocks is a more useful design. 

## Block/cell-based New design

How to choose the macro-architecture: how many cells shall be used and how should they be connected to build the actual model? Hard-coded macro architecture:

- `Each cell receives the outputs of the two preceding cells as input.`
- Manually designed architectures, eg., DenseNet

In general the cell based searching includes 3 steps:

1. Define a set of primitive operations
2. connect primitive operations and form the cell
3. Hard-coded macro-architecture. 

# Search Stratey

Search strategies: random search, Bayesian optimization, evolutionary methods, reinforcement learning, and gradient-based methods.
