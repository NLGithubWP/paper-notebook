# File Storage

## Propority

Each file is s single piece and stores at one location. 

Data in a file storage system is organized in a hierarchical system of folders, directories, and sub-directories.

Files have limited metadata attached to them – usually just the basic file attributes, such as name, date of creation, and date last modified. Each file has a unique file path that functions as its address within the storage system. 

Cloud file storage is frequently supported by a network-attached server (NAS)

## Usage

Common applications for file storage in the cloud include content or document management systems, recordkeeping, and digital libraries.

# Object Storage

## Propority

`defination`

Object storage is a data storage architecture used by organizations of all sizes and across industries to store and access **large amounts of unstructured data** in a **highly scalable and cost-effective way.**

`architecture`

Objects in the cloud are stored in a “flat” hierarchy with no folders or directories, a feature that allows for **consistent, low-latency data access**.

Object storage systems on **multiple devices (servers) can be aggregated to form a single object storage cluster**. A storage cluster can be **scaled horizontally and almost infinitely** by adding more servers that may be **distributed across multiple locations**. 

Generally 3 copys of data is maintained. 

`object`

Dhe data in a file is broken into **pieces called objects**, each object acts as a self-contained data repository with three components.

1. Piece of data from the original file.
2. **Rich metadata** that can be customized based on the type of data and its intended use.
3. A **unique identifying number** that enables API access to the object.

`unstructured data` and `structured Data`

Unstructured data is **not organized in any predefined manner**. Instead, the data is stored in its native format and can include text files, images, audio recordings, video surveillance records, and more.

Structured data is “organized into specific fields as part of a schema, with each field having a defined purpose”. Structured data is usually quantitative data stored in a table format or a relational database.

## Usage

Cloud, eg, AWS, IBM, AZURE, ORACLE. ALIBABA.

# Block Storage

## Propority

Block storage is a data storage methodology that uses **Storage Area Networks (SANs)** to **decouple data from user environments**, allowing for rapid data access and ultra low-latency data retrieval in the cloud. 

In a block storage system, data in files are separated into **uniformly-sized chunks known as blocks.** Each block is stored separately, along with a unique identifier code that allows it to be located within the storage system. 

When a file is requested from block storage, all of the blocks that comprise the file are accessed **parallelly** from their separate storage locations and reassembled before being presented to the application or user.

Parallely data retrieval from cloud or directly retrieval from local drive offers **lowest possible latency**, also help in keep data consistent. 

## Usage

It is considered the best data storage option for high-performance applications that require **consistent, low-latency** data retrieval. These applications include **relational databases** like SQL Server or Oracle and ERP solutions like SAP.

### Managing Unstructured Data at Scale

When it comes to storing and organizing unstructured data at scale, there’s no better option than cloud object storage. 

As file storage systems increase in size, file paths get more complex and data retrieval performance may decline, but object storage avoids this with its flat storage architecture.

Unlimited horizontal scalability is also a key benefit, with organizations more willing to invest in data storage solutions that can expand to meet their needs in the future.

### Cost-Effective Data Storage

Most of the unstructured data in the cloud lives in cloud object storage services like Amazon S3. Cloud object storage doesn’t just perform well at scale, it’s also cost-effective with different storage tiers available based on how frequently the data is accessed and how quickly it may need to be recovered.

### Customizable Metadata

Objects in cloud storage can be configured with **customizable** metadata. Metadata describes the data in the object file, enhances its searchability in cloud object storage, and may reveal new insights if the data is processed by a machine learning algorithm or predictive analytics engine.
