# Questions

This is almost impossible to implement and to tune. 

# Introduction

## Background & Motivation

**Stand-alone database**: data storage, data management and query processing;  PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Cluster Database**: high availability and reliability: DB2 and SQL server.

**Distribured Databases** (cloud-native database): elastic computing and dynamic data migration

## Gap

Exisitng DB cannot support various applications and diversified computer power.

- AI for DB
- DB for AI: design in-database machine learning frameworks, which utilize DB techinques to accelerate AI algorithm
- GPU hardware integration

## Goal

The paper try to propose a DB system design and challenges in providing follow properities.

- Self-configuring, self-optimizing, self-monitoring, and self-diagnosis etc.
- Provide AI capabilities using declarative languages
- Utilize diversified computing pwoer to support data analysis and ML.

# DB4AI

### AI as UDF

Model can be embeded in the DB and we could provide UDF or stored procedures for each algorithm. Then use can call UDFS or SPs to use AI algorithm.

### AI as Views

Make the trained AI algorithm as a view, which is shared by multiple users. The model can be then updated offline.

### Model-free AI

Database can automatically recommend the algorithms fir the user scenarios.
