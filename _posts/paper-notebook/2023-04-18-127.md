# Introduction

## Background & Motivation

**Distributed Stream Jobs:**

- execution plan: DAG, operators -> physical paralle tasks.
  - Vertices: tasks
  - Edget: data flow between tasks. 
- Workloads: input data of an operator.

**Control policy:** 

- Monitors the stream job and decide whether or not to update it.
- Identify the performance bottlenect, and use reconfigurations to optimize it.

**Reconfigurations**: low-latecy on stream jobs requires system can reconfigure part of dataflow computation dynamically during execution without affecting the correctness of processing logic.

- **Versatility**: reconfigurations mainly include operations along three dimension: 

  - **resource**: amount of resources allocated to a task, CPU cores and memory.

    There is need to reallocate resource for stream jobs to achive better resoruce utilization. Thus needs Reconfigurations.

  - **workloads**: partition the workloads to a task of an operator. 

    User can adjust the workloading over tasks, scalling out/in by adding/removing tasks. Each task has a state, thus needs Reconfigurations

  - **execution** logic: UDF updated, thus needs Reconfigurations

- **Efficiency**: Must finish reconfigurations quickly, e,g. minimize the sync time between parallel tasks.
  **sync** is to make all parallel tasks to be paused at the same logical time to avoid data loss or data duplication during reconfiguration execution

- **Usability**: easy-to-use API

## Goal

Control plane solution supports reconfigurations of stream jobs.

# Details

### Reconfiguration Execution

To reduce the latency and maintain the consistency of , it uses **partial pause-and-resume scheme** and is able to leverage the mechanisms in native stream systems for tasks synchronization.

Upon receiving reconfigurations request, 

- it uses a coordinator to generate a new DAG execution plan, detect all tasks by comparing the DAG. 
- pause tha affected tasks, and sync the them (with native system's mechanism, like Flink's async checkpoint machanism).
- update task with new configs.

### IMPLEMENTATION

Runtime + stream system

Runtime: abstractiona nd reconfiguration APIs for user.

Stream system instrouctions: 

- efficient execution of reconfigurations requred from runtime.
- leverage sync mechanism in native stream system, and work collaborate with each tasks' ConfigManager.

On Flink:

- map abstraction to configurations in Flinks `JobGraph` and `ExecutionGraph`
