Existing performance predictors cannot predict the performance of **concurrent** queries

-  hard to capture the correlation between various queries. **(lock conflict and buffer sharin**g)



This paper 

- Proses a performance prediction system based on a **graph embedding-based model.**

- Propose a graph update and compaction algorithm to adapt to workload changes, since workloads may dynamically change.

  



For a set of queries, they get the physical plan for each query, and then **add an edge between them** if there are few conditions:

- parent-child relationship in the same query plan; 
- (2) data-sharing: they access the same data, i.e., visiting the same table or index; 
- (3) data conflict: they have read-write/write-write access conflicts; 
- (4) resource-competition: they compete for the resource at the same time, e.g., competing memory, CPU, I/O bandwidth;
