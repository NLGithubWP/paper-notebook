# Introduction

**Query rewrite:** transforms a SQL query into an equivalent one but with higher performance.

**Challenges:**

Order is important in rewriting, but there are huge numbers of orders.

- How to represent such a large amount of orders is a major challenge.
- Given a large search space, how to find the optimal order efficiently?
- How to estimate the cost reduction of a rewrite?

**GAP:**

Existing heuristics methods have limitations:

- it uses a **pre-defined order** to rewrite the queries and will fall in a local optimum.
- it is hard to effectively estimate the benefits of rewriting a query.

**Solution**

SQL query + a set of rewrite rules => LearnedRewrite => optimized rewritten query.

- policy tree -> represent the order search space
- Monte Carlo Tree Seach to explore the tree and find the optimal node.
