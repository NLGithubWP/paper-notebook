Anytime prediction:

- An anytime predictor produces a coarse result quickly, and then continues to refine it until the test-time computational budget is depleted.

Gap:

- Thus, it can be difficult for such applications to choose between slow predictors with high accuracy and fast predictors with low accuracy.
- At any test-time budget, the anytime predictor has a valid result for the sample, and the more budget is spent, the better the prediction is.

This paper weighted sum the loss generated by each sub-network composed previous `L` proceeding layer.
