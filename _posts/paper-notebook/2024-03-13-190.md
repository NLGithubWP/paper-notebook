QO-based approach may have key limitations related to generalization.

Optimizations: Join order, Physical Operators (Index scan, Sequential scan, Hash join, Nested loop join, Merge join)

Balsa, Bao as baselines, it shwos Balsa trained on the cannot generalize to unseen workloads.



Solutions: combine Lookahead Information Passing (LIP), Adaptive Join Algorithm (AJA) to buidl a new adaptive query processing optimizatioin mechanisms.



Lookahead Information Passing:



- Execute the most selective join operation firstreduce the tuples passed to the subsequent join operations.
- lookahead bloom filters to pre-filter the rows, makeing the query execution not sensitive to the join orders.



join orders selected by Balsa contribute more towards improved performance, making join order selection a critical contribution of
