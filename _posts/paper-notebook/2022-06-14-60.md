# Introduction



Knative uses Kubernetes as a container manager. Istio as network routing manager, and also propose **Build, Eventing, Serving**.

## Build: 

CI/CD 

automates the process of turning source code into a container

## Evening

Eventing is implemented by using a message queue like Kafka. 

The Eventing component of Knative enables different events to trigger their container-based services and functions

## Knative Serving

Provides:

1. fast deployment container
2. autoscaling: Knative provides automatic scaling to match incoming demands. This is provided using Knative Pod Autoscaler. (KPA)
3. support multiple networking layers
4. snapshots of deployed code/configurations.

Resources:

1. service: Manage the whole lifecycle of the workload. It creates objects to ensure each app has a route, cfgs, and revisions for each update.

2. Route: Map a network endpoint to one or more revisions.
3. cfgs
4. Revision: A snapshot of code and cfgs.
