# Introduction

## Problem

Asynchronous Data Dissemination (ADD) Problem:

- in an **asynchronous** network, n nodes with **t nodes malicious.** 
- The goal is to disseminate a **data blob from a subset of honest nodes** to **all honest nodes**, despite the presence of some malicious nodes
- Formally, the goal is that a subset of **at least t +1 honest nodes** start with a common message **blob M**, and t hen all honest nodes output M at the end of the protocol.

## Solution

The paper designs a simple and efficient ADD protocol that is 

- information-theoretically secure: it does not rely on any cryptographic assumption
- tolerates up to 1/3 of malicious nodes. i.e., n >= 3t + 1
- communication cost of O(n|M| + n^2) to disseminating a message M.

The protocol can be used to improve **Asynchronous reliable broadcast (RBC)**, and then the improved RBC can improve the communication cost of

- Asynchronous atomic broadcast and Asynchronous distributed key generation protocol (ADKG)
- Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing (AVSS), 
- Asynchronous Complete Secret Sharing (ACSS), 
- Dual-threshold ACSS from O(kn^2logn) to O(kn^2) without using any trusted setup.

Notes:

- RBC: an asynchronous reliable broadcast protocol implements a broadcast channel in an asynchronous network and ensures that all honest nodes in the network deliver the same message **if any honest node delivers or if the broadcaster is honest.**

# Methods

## Overview of the solution

1. The input message M is transformed into n symbols using the Error-Correcting Code.
2. Each node has one encoded symbol, e.g., i-th node takes the i-th symbol
3. If a node doesn't have input, it can obtain the symbol by receiving it from i+1 nodes that have input message M.
4. Once every node i has its symbol, it disseminates or disperses it to other nodes.
5. Honest nodes are then collected symbols. Once an honest node collects 2t+1 symbols, it can reconstruct a new message M'.
6. The node then encodes M′ again using the same error-correcting code, turning it into a set of symbols. Then the node checks whether this new set of encoded symbols contains at least 2t+1 symbols that match the originally received symbols.
7. If matching, the **node outputs the reconstructed message.** This is a verification step.

## Improved RBC

It combines Bracha’s classic RBC protoco with the propose ADD to improved RBC

- running Bracha's RBC protocol on the has digest of M can establish exactly the initial condition for ADD

# System model

**Cryptographic assumptions**

- hash(.) denote the collision resistant hash function.
- k denote the size of the cryptographic object.

**Network and adversarial assumptions**

- Async network n>= 3t + 1, at most t malicious nodes
- Adversary can delay or reorder messages between honest nodes, but must eventually deliver every message.

**Encodes**

- RSEnc(M, m, k): encode message **M** with **k symbols** and outputs **m evaluations**.
- RSDec(k, r, T): Takes inputs a set of symbols T, outputs **k symbols** by correcting up to **r errors in T**
  if |T| > k + 2r, it can work.

# Async data dissemination

Number of **honest sender** node must be at least **t+1**

Simple solutions

- t+1 honest senders just send M to all others, and others once receive **t+1 matching message M**, it outputs **M**.
- this is **not communication efficient**, since totla communication cost os O(n^2|M|)
  Specifically, one node sends (n-1)|M| to all other nodes. n nodes send out n(n-1)|M| messages. Thus totally, n^2|M|

The paper solution

- n >= 3t + 1: information theoretically secure.
- n >= 2t + 1: needs a collision resistant hash function.

## n >= 3t + 1 solution

Three phases: **encoding phase**, **dispersal phase**, and **reconstruction phase**.

**Encoding phase:**

- Every sender (with messsage M) encodes M using (n, t+1) **Reed-Solomon code**, that is M includes t + 1 symbols, but outputs n symbols.
- The encoded message M' = [m_1 .... m_n] of n symbols, and the size of symbol is 
  **|M'|** = n|M| / (t + 1) => |M'| / n = **|M| / (t + 1)**
  here each simple has size of |M| / (1+t), while |M'| is the sume of the n symbols, thus it's above

**Dispersal phase**:

- Aftering encoding M =>M', every node sender sends the message <disperse, mj> to node j.
- Node j, once received t + 1 matching disperse message for a symbol mj', it sets mj' as the reconstruction symbol mj*.

**Reconstruction Phase**

- Every node sends <reconstruct, i, mi*> to all other nodes.
- Every recipient, upon receiving enough symbols, uset he online error correcting algirithm to reconstruct it.
  - wait until |T| >=2t + r + 1.
  - let pr(.) := RSDec(t + 1, r, T).
  - if reconstructed polynomial agrees with **2t+1** points in the reconstruct message, the recipient outputs the decoded message.

# Anaylsis

This it prove that Alg1 can solve ADD problem

- Every honest node will hold the **correct reconstruction symbol** at the end of **dispersal phase.**
- Every honest node can successfully reconsructs the message M.

**LEMMA 3.2.** After the dispersal phase each honest node j holds **mj*** where mj* is the j-th coordinate of M′= RSEnc(M,n,t + 1)

- RSEnc is **determinstic**, and  **t + 1** honest node must send out.
- **Eventually**, node must receivet **t + 1** messages , and then will hold mj* at the end of the dispersal phase.

**Lemma 3.3.** At the end of the reconstruction phase of Algorithm 1, every honest node outputs M.

- An honest recipient node will never output a wrong message.
  - Logic:
    - There are 2t+1 honest nodes.
    - Eaech recipient will receive 2t+1 symbols from the last phase, and then construct **𝑝𝑟(·)**
    - Among the recipient, there are t+1 honest sender, which has ground truth **𝑝(·)**
    - The polynomials has the same degree, thus if **𝑝(·)** and **𝑝𝑟(·)** are matching, they are same.
  - **𝑝𝑟(·)**: This represents a polynomial that `node 𝑖` **produces** (or outputs) during the 𝑟th iteration. It is what the node believes to be the correct message during that specific iteration.
  - **𝑝(·)**: This represents the **actual correct polynomial** (or message) that nodes are trying to determine or agree upon. It's the "target" polynomial that an honest node should produce.
  - **𝑇𝑟**: This is the set of **symbols** (or data points) that `node 𝑖` used to come up with its **polynomial 𝑝𝑟(·)** during the 𝑟th iteration.
- Honest recipient will eventually output a message
  - Every honest will eventually receives 2t+1 correct symbols, and at most t correct symbols.
  - RSDec algorithm (RSDec(k, r, T) is able to correct up to **r errors in T** )
  - Thus, honest nodes will sucuessfully reconstruct the original message M

**Lemma 3.4**: Total communication cost: **Cumulative amount of data transmitted and received among entities** 

- It's O(n|M| + N^2)
- Each sender nodes sends a message of size |M'|/n + O(1) to n nodes, 
  thus it's communication cost is n(|M'|/n + O(1)),  n nodes will do this a this step, thus it's (t+1)*n(|M'|/n + O(1))
- At the construction phase, each node sends a message of size |M'|/n + O(1) to others, for one node, comm cost is n*(|M'|/n + O(1) )
  For n nodes, the total is n^2(|M'|/n + O(1) ) => O(n|M'| + n^2)
- Here O(1) is a constant overhead of sending each message.

**Theorem 3.5:** In an asynchronous network of 𝑛 = 3𝑡 + 1 nodes, of which up to 𝑡 nodes can be malicous, Algorithm 1 solves ADD with a communication complexity of 𝑂(𝑛|𝑀|+𝑛 2 ).

- Derived from Lemma3.2, 3.3, and 3.4

Communicaiton cost:

- encoding stepL O(n^2) operations. (additions and multiplications)
- reconstruct: decode t times, each with O(npolylog(n))

# Reliable Broadcast

The paper propose two RBC for long messges

- Simpler and use Bracha's RBC and ADD in a modular way, but requires two additional rounds of communication than Bracha's RBC.
- Second one merges the Bracha's RBC and ADD and matches the round complexity of RBC.

## Defination

A protocol for a set of nodes {1, ....,n}, where a distinguished node called the broadcaster holds an initial input M of size |M|, is a reliable broadcast protocol, if the following properties hold

- **Agreement**: If a honest node outputs a message M', another output M'', then M' == M''
- **Validity**: one broadcaster is honest, all others eventually output M.
- **Totality**: One honest node outputs a message, then every honest node eventually outputs a message;

## Bracha's RBC

- quorum intersection (ECHO message) => for agreement
- vote amplification of ready message => totality.
- including M in each message, leading to O(n^2|M|) commnication cost.
- Why 2t + 1 in the 1st phase? t+1 in 2nd, 2t+1 in 3rd?
  - 

## Cachin Tessaro RBC

- Attaching Merkle Path Proofs in the message, incurs a commnication cost of O(n|M| + kn^2logn)

## The Proposed First RBC protocol

- Run Bracha's RBC only on the hash of the message M, **disseminate** the message M using ADD.
- Question:
  - why needs ADD after using hash?

## Analysis of Alg3

**Lemma 4.2**: If any honest node executes ADD(𝑀), then there are at least 2𝑡 + 1 nodes, among which at least 𝑡 + 1 are honest nodes, that receive 𝑀 from the broadcaster and send ⟨ECHO, ℎ⟩ to all other nodes where ℎ = hash(𝑀).

**Lemma 4.3**: If any honest node executes ADD(𝑀), then **at least 𝑡 + 1 honest nodes execute ADD(𝑀)** and the rest of the honest nodes execute ADD(⊥).

- if one honest node execute ADD(M), it means the node receive 2t+1 matching receive M and send <ECHO,h>. Then since any two 2t+1 must interacte at one honest node, and it doesn'y lie. Thus no other 2t+1 send other msg != M.
- t + 1 honest nodes: After the two rounds of ready voting, all honest nodes will eventually receive 2t+1 Ready Message, and execute ADD(.), since they can either execute ADD(M) or ADD(None),.
  Since Lemma 4.2, at least t+1 honest node receive M from broadcaster, thus the t+1 nodes execute the ADD(M)
