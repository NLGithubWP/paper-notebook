Query rewrite transforms a SQL query into an **equivalent** one but with **higher** **performance**.

Existing problems

- How to represent the large search space or rewrite order.
- how to define the order? The order of applying different rewrite rules significantly affects the query performance.
- How to estimate the cost reduction of a rewrite? Rewriting rules functions differently for different queries. 



This paper propose a query rewritten system, which accept (query + rewrite rules) => optimal rewrite order + query

- Model possible orders as a policy tree, root = input query. path = an rewritten order.
- Note utility:
  - cost between latency of executing original and current node + access pattern.
- Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore the policy tree to find the optimal node
- Cost estimation
  - M_R[i,j]: cost reduction of applying rule j to operator i
  - Q_C[i,j]: operator i contains columsn j
  - M_R[i,j]: index, distinct value
