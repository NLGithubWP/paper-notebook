This paper proposes an end-to-end automatic CDB tuning system, which 

- uses the deep deterministic policy gradient method to find the optimal configurations in high-dimensional continuous space.
- adopts a **try-and-error strategy** to learn knob settings with a limited number of samples to accomplish the initial training
- adopts the reward-feedback mechanism in RL instead of traditional regression, which enables end-to-end learning and accelerates the convergence speed 



### RL for tunning



State: Got from the "show status".

Reward: performance changed (latency/throughput)

Action: change tunable knobs

Policy: a DNN, db status => DNN => recommended knobs.



Training data: 

(q, a, s, r), q is a set of query workloads, a is the knobs and values, s is the db status, and r is the performance when processing q.



### Insights:

value-based and policy-based, 

Q-learning is effective in a relatively small state space. However, it is hard to solve the problem of a large state

DQN can model the states, but DQN is a discrete-oriented control algorithm, which means the actions of output are discrete

It uses Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
