# Introduction

## Background & Motivation

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) requires either `compute-intensive` or `memory-intensive ` smart contract at different times. Autoscaling can increase the throughput but cannot imporve the resource utilization of each component. 

- Compute-intensive: AI-driven blockchains, Blockchain safeguard the integrity of the data.

In resource disaggregation design, resources are reorganized from servers to physically distinct pools that are dedicated to processing, memory or storage, those are connected with a fast network such as RDMA.

It has benefits:

- Independent elasticity of resources. (Upgrade and exapnd each resource independently.)
- Efficient resource utilization.

## Challenge

How to improve the resource utilization in BaaS.

## Gap



## Goal

This paper propsoes a disaggregated permissioned blockchain service.

- tiered world state
- parallel validation stage
