# Introduction

## Background & Motivation

Most existing HTAP systems assume a 'greenfield' (Single System for OLTP and OLAP). 

For the situation where data is stored in a separate system and cannot easily do a wholesale migration, HTAP needs to perform over many storage engines. 

## Gap

Greenfield systems cannot handle the situation where the data is stored on multiple data stores. In this situation, a federated query engine is needed.

## Challenge

It's challenging to design a federated HTAP engine to support both new and legacy applications that demand transparent, fast queries and transactions.

## Goal

The paper tries to propose an HTAP solution that can be enabled across the different options for transactional storage to **avoid costly migrations** and to **permit flexibility** in the design of transactional storage systems. 

And we want to benefit from the separation of concerns by allowing,

- TP systems to focus on transaction processing.
- AP engines focus on query processing, with an emphasis on analytical queries.

# Technique details

## Assume

The F1 Lightning uses a "Separate OLTP and OLAP Systems" design and decoupled storage. It assumes no modifications can be made to the OLTP storage.
