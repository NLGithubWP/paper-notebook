# Question

1. Why it is faster than Data parallelism with (ASP and BSP), Model parallelism, Hybrid parallelism, and pipeline parallelims ?

   It basically integrate all the benefits of above systems. 

   E,g. It mainly use Pipeline Parallelism; add stage replication (similary to data parallelism); update weight immediately while use weight stashing to provide effective training. 

# Introduction

## Background & Motivations

DNNs are getting larger and computationally expensive to train, thus requires parallel execution acorss multiple accelerators. 

## Gap

Intra-batch parallelization: 

- Data parallelism with BSP/ASP. Where the worker receive the gradients. 
  - Limitations is mianly on communinication. 
  - Data-parallelization training suffer from high communication cost at large scale. E,g. when workers == 32, the communication cost takes 90% of total training time. 
- Model parallelism:
  - Limitations: under-utilizations of GPUs and unconvenience of the manually partitioning. 

Inter-batch parallelism:

- Pipeline parallelism. E,g. GPipe.

## Goal

Propose an system using pipeline parallelism to enable **faster** DNN training by combining intra-batch parallelism with inter-batch parallelization.

It can outperform intra-batch parallelism because:

- Low communication overahead compared with data parallelism
- Overlaps the computations and communications of different inputs in a pipelined fasion to achieve **high hardware efficiency** .

- **High statistical efficiency** (number of iterations needed to reach a particular target accuracy) comparable to data parallelism using the same number of workers.

## Challenges

DNN training is bi-directional thus incurs some challenges for using pipelining. 

- Inject all minibatches in an epoch 
  - => cannot reach desired target accuracy since gradients are averages over all training samples. 
- Inject m minibatches and update weight every m minibatches. (GPipe) 
  - => reduce the hardware efficiency (many unused time unit for each hardware. )

### Worker Partitioning

**Obj**:

- high hardware efficiency. 

Problem defination:

- Each stage has euqal time usage and less idel time => better hardware efficiency. 
- Less communication => better hardware efficiency.
- Each operator have different stage, thus uniformally split the model may not the optimal.

**Solution:**

- Replicate the slow stage (data parallelism) to reduce increase the throughput. 
- Propose a partition algorithm to ensure each stage completes at roughly the same rate, while trying to minimize communication across workers in a topology-aware way. It computes
  - **partition** of layer into each stage, 
  - **replication** factor for each stage, 
  - optimal **number of mini-batches to kee**p training pipeline bust. 

- The partition algorithm replies on a profiler to measure time of F/B pass, size the layer outputs, size of parameters.

### Worker scheduling

**Obj**:

- High resource utilization.

**Problems**:

- determine whether it should perform forward/backward/ tasks.
- determine how the minibatches be routed with replicated stages.

**Solution**:

- 1F1B scheduling. Worker alternate between F/B pass
- Gradients are used to update model wieght immediately. (GPipe need to wait for gradient aggregation, thus slows the resource utilization. )

### Effective Learning

**Obj:**

- Effective learning.

**Problem**:

- Forward on one minibatch using w0, and backward may updates on w1 (w0 is already updated by another mini-batch.). Which chould reduce the effectivness. 

**Solution**:

- Use **weight stashing** to avoid the mismatch between weights of a single stage/GPU.
  - Weight stashing cannot guarantee the consistency across stages. 
- Vertical Sync:
  - Eliminates the potential inconsistency across stages.

â€‹	Multiple version of weights are averaged together perofidically?

# Evaluation

Macro-bechmarks

1. Speedups in Time-to-target-accuracy.
   - Compared with data parallelism, PipeDream is much faster due to less communication cost.
   - Compared with data parallelism of ASP, PipeDream is much accurate due to weight stashing. 
   - Compared with model parallelism (w/o pipelininn or replication). PipeDream is much faster when adding pipelining and replication. 
   - Compared with hybrid parallelism. PipeDream is much faster due to overlapping communication and computation. 
2. Reduce the overheads of communications without increasing memory usage.
   - compared with GPipe.
