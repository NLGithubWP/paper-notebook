# Question

# Introduction

## Background & Motivations

DNN models grow in size and leading high resource costs. 

It is important to train the large model at a low cost. 

## Gap

Most existing work only focus on scalability and efficiency, with high cost. Not much consider cost-efficiency (performance per dollar.)

## Challenge

s

## Goal

This paper tries to propose a cost-efficiency ML system to train large model.
