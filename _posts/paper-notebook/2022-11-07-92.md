# Question

# Introduction

## Background & Motivations

Data-parallelization training suffer from diminishing returns at higher work counts. 

DNNs are getting larger and computationally expensive to train, thus requires parallel execution acorss multiple accelerators. 

## Gap

Most existing work only focus on scalability and efficiency, with high cost. Not much consider cost-efficiency (performance per dollar.)

## Challenge

s

## Goal

This paper tries to propose a cost-efficiency ML system to train large model.
