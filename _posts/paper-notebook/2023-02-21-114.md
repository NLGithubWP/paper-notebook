# Questions
This is mainly use some traditional techniques, and simply combine multiple ML stage into a pipeline. 

# Introduction
## Background & Motivation
How to choose algorithms and how to scale the ML are challenging tasks for ML researchs.

## Goal
The paper presents MLbase:

- Declarative way to specify ML tasks
- Optimizer to select and adapt the learning algorithm with a sophisticated cost-based model. 
- high-level operators to enable ML researches to implement ML methods.
- Run-time optimized for data-acces pattern.

Some Optimizations used:

- use pruning heuristics and online model selection tools to improve the searching efficiency. 
- Apply data process techniques to before attempting other more complicated techniques.
