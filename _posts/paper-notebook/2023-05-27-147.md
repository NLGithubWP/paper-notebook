# Introduction

This paper mainly propose to use NVLink to reduce the overhead of the data access between CPU and GPU, such that the data access overhead will not downgrade the performance of RDBMS on GPU device.

It summarizes and proposes many data access solutions and conduct experiments to illustrate their advantages/disadvantages.
