categories: [A paper note]

## Introduction

The paper focused on developing a **distributed** **OLTP** system running on cluster of **shared-nothing machines** where the data resides entirely in **main memory.**

## System Overview

![image-20230607173655204](../../img/a_img_store/image-20230607173655204.png)

Nodes have many sites, each site is single-threaded daemon.

Each relation is devidided into multiple partitions, each in one site.

## PROPERTIES

Estimate the values of transaction parametres, and infer the target site using the cardinality of the columns refrenced in the query.

Fast vs high availability

- **Fast**: fewer site involved, few communications.
- **High-availability**: it use non-volatile storage and reply on strategic data distribution schemes to maintain high-availability. To tolerate K nodes failure, it must store copy to many sites, thus consuming to much memory and reduce the throughput.
