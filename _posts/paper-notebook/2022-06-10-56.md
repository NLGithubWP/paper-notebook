# Introduction

## Motivation

Cohort analysis processing is a data analysis technique for assessing the effects of aging on human behavior in a changing society. But it is hard to implement in traditional DBMS

## Contributions

1. Define cohort analytics problems. 

2. Introduce the extended relation to model user data for cohort analytics, and introduce three new operators for it. 

   - Two of them can extract a subset of activities. 
   - The last one can aggregate over arbitrary attribute combinations.

3. Build a columnar-based cohort query engine with many optimizations.

4. Design benchmark study. 

   # SQL-based cohort analysis

Activate table has a primary key constraint on (Au; At; Ae). And many attributes.  User (Au), timestamp (At), and action (Ae) attribute

## Basic concepts

birth action: Action e

birth time: First-time user performs e

age: Age is a certain time unit such as a day, week, or month.
