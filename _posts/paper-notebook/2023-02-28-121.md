# Summary


# Introduction

Integrating analytics into DBMS may introduce some deployment overhead due to lacking unified architecture in-database analytics, which enables generically performance optimizations. For example, two factors influence performance:

- **data ordering**
- the **parallelization** of computations in single-node multicore RDMBs.

This paper then tries to investigate those two factors theoretically and empirically and then proposes a **feasible** novel unified architecture for general in-database analysis.

- Integrating many data analytics tasks which can be formulated as Incremental Gradient Descent.
- Develop a novel strategy to improve the performance, which is limited by the bad ordering in RDMS.
- Adapt existing approaches to make them run in parallel.

# Architecture

## Data order

The paper shows that some data orderings allow the IGD algorithm to converge in fewer epochs than others.

## Parallelism

IGD can be run in parallel in nature.

Shard memory outperforms the shared-nothing architecture in distributed training in accuracy, while shared memory can also be lockless because of the nature of the IGD algorithms.
