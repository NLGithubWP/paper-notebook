Meta-leaner is trained on a **distribution** of similar tasks, in the hopes of generalization to **novel but related tasks** by learning a high-level strategy that captures the essence of the problem it is asked to solve.

Recent meta-learning approaches are extensively hand-designed, either using architectures specialized to a particular application, or hard-coding algorithmic components that constrain how the meta-learner solves the task.

This paper propose a simple and generic meta-learner architectures.
