# Introduction

## Background & Motivation

Bring DNNs into various hardware is important rearch area.

There are two communities optimizing DNNs for commodity devices. 

- NAS: trade off between size and acc
- Compiler: optimize the existing well-defisned model by restructureing underlying tensor computations.

## Gap

Few works of NAS consider the hardware behavior, but has problems:

- Having complex methods for predicating the search space.
- Having fixed pipeline, and miss powerful candidate architectures.
- Limited to selecting from a pre-designed list of CNN operations. 

## Challenge

s

## Goal

This paper combine neural architecture and compiler optimization in a unified framework to achieve NAS in hardware aware manner. 

- This paper recasts neural architecture search as program transformation exploration.

- combines the NAS and compiler optimizations.
