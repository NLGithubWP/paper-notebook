This paper designs and implements PilotScop with a programming model to facilitate the integration of AI into DB.



1. data collections: cardinality, plan cost, execution time, 
2. inject ML task into database
3. ML environment to support the execution
4. interaction between ML and database at runtime.
5. AI and DB can developed independently.
