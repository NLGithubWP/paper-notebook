# Introduction

## Background & Motivation

Complex OLAP query requires strong data consistency and sub-second delay. 

## Gap

OLAP database may read stale data. OLTP databases lack massive parallel processing capability. 

## Goal

To build large-scale real-time HTAP supporting fresh data changes and strong data consistency. 

- Scale up to petabytes of data.
- Low-performance degradation on either OLAP and OLTP.
- Fresh delay: < 1s
- Strong data consistency: a consistent global snapshot.
