   # Execution Model and Definitions

   Delta-bounded assumption.

   # Streamlet protocol: partially synchronous

   Epochs, leaders, blockchains, 

   votes and notarization, 

   protocol:

   ​	what is notarized and finalized.

   Liveness

   1. Theorem4

      After GST, every 5 consecutive epochs, every honest node must have observed a new final block that is not final at the beginning of epoch e.
