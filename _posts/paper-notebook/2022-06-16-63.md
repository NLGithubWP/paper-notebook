# Introduction

## History of Datawarehouse

### Schema 

Schema-on-write: schema is well-defined when writing data into storage.

Schema-on-read: schema is defined when reading data for analysis.

### First-generation

It coupled compute and storage into an on-premises appliance, and enterprises have to pay for it. 

Datasets are becoming unstructured, video, audio, and texts. The data warehouse cannot store and query them.

### Second generation









## LakeHouse

The paper shows LakeHouse has the following advantages:

1. Based on open direct-access data formats, like Parquet, ORC,
2. First-class support for ML
3. Offers state-of-art performance. 

It can address several challenges: data staleness, reliability, the total cost of ownership, data lock-in, and limited use-case support.

The paper shows that LakeHouse is competitive with cloud data warehouses on TPC-DS
