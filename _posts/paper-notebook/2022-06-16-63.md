# Introduction

The paper shows LakeHouse has the following advantages:

1. Based on open direct-access data formats, like Parquet, ORC,
2. First-class support for ML
3. Offers state-of-art performance. 

It can address several challenges: data staleness, reliability, the total cost of ownership, data lock-in, and limited use-case support.

The paper shows that LakeHouse is competitive with cloud data warehouses on TPC-DS
