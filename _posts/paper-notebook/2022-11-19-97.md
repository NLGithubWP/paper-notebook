# Introduction

## Background & Motivation

Decentralization is a fundamental basis for blockchain systems, including permissionless (Bitcoin, Eth) and permissioned systems (Hypeledget Fabric, Corda). 

However, many applications deploy their permissioned blockchain node in a single service provider, leading to a centralized infrastructure. Thus, the necessity of decentralization property needs to be re-examined.

## Gap





## Challenge



## Goal

To reform the decentralization in permissioned blockchains.

This paper proposes a centralized ledger database to provide tamper-evidence and non-repudiation features. 

- Strong auditability.
- High performance.

# Technique details

## Assume

The F1 Lightning uses a "Separate OLTP and OLAP Systems" design and decoupled storage. It assumes no modifications can be made to the OLTP storage.
