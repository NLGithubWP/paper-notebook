# Introduction

This work try to provide a tool for DBAs to visilaize and see why query plans generated by learned query optimizers outperform those generated by traditional optimizers.

Design targets:

1. multiple exploration modes (query-centric vs. rulecentric)
2. support for multiple performance metrics (latency, number of page spills)
3. visual comparison of query plans
4. support for interactive retrieve the relevant information.

# System

It uses **exposed knobs** to steer query optimization.

It measures the query based on wall time, the number of page accesses, and the memory footprint.
