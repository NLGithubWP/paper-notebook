# Introduction


PostgreSQL has good extensibility.

Traditionally, new RDBMS is implemented by

- Build a datbase engine from scratch and write a layer to provide SQL compatibility.
- Fork an opensource and build some feature on top of it.
- Build a layer between DB and application.

This paper try to build a distributed database using PostgreSQL extension APIs, and to add 

- sharding layer
- disributed query planner and executor
- distributed transactions.
