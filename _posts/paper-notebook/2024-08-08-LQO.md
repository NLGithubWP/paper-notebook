# 1. DSB datasets

Existing benchmarks lack of 

1. more distinct query instances
2. dynamic workloads
3. guidance of comprehensively comparing the performance trade-offs for workload-driven and traditional database systems.

## Shift

Skew

- Both exponential / Zipfian distributions are for those where the common value is more frequent 
- The exponential distribution is often used for modeling **time-related data** or "waiting times," while Zipfian is used to model scenarios where there is a **ranking or ordering of items**, such as popularity.Zipfian

## Workloads

1. skews and correlations, skews on individual columns, correlations between columns in the same table, and correlations of columns across multiple tables.

   **=> more skews and correlations to individual columns and multiple columns within a table and across tables.**

2. more join patterns: including non-equi joins and cyclic join graphs.

   **=> new query templates to enrich the join patterns.**

3. slice data at a fine granularity with multiple predicate filters on table columns. 

   **=> fine-grained data slicing with additional predicate filters.**

4. **=> configurable parameterization to generate queries.**

5. **=> comprehensive user guidance.**



## Experiments





# 2. Modeling Shifting Workloads for Learned Database Systems

## Takeaways

## Problems

The key question is when and how best to re-train the model.

1. Retraining within near queries => catastrophic forgetting, large queries => time-consuming.

2. Workload imbalance leads to poor performance.

## Assumptions

Assumes the **underlying data** to be static.

## Techniques

### Query Type, Query Encoding

As in other papers

### Model

distributed shift detector (per l query) => train a new model/retrain the existing model with the importance of past/current queries.

- KS test for measuring the distribution of each feature of two samples.
- Bonferroni correction to adjust the significance level.

online clustering algorithm (Bayesian non-parametric models) => managing the replay buffer => providing data to re-train.

- cluster based on the query feature encoding, other than learned embedding or gradients.
- propose DP-Medoides based K-Medoids, since it is more robust to outliers/supports customerize distnace computes.
- manage the reply buffer such that its balance, diversified.

re-training: combined loss of pass and current queries.

## Workloads

### Datasets

IMDB with JOB

DSB (50GB)

the query join graph and/or the distribution of query **predicates** may shift with time.

### Dynamic Workload

1. Generate a query pool with each query classes having 200 queries.
2. shifting workloads: 
   1. randomly pick three classes (fixed)
   2. for each class, randomly pick 100 queries
   3. concatenate those queries.
   4. repeate from 2-4 to form a workload with queries A(100), B(100), C(100), A(100)...
3. measure performance after retraining and evaluate in other classes (except the current one).

# 3. Balsa

## Takeaways

Neo-impl is still not robust enough to generalize to unseen test queries and suffers from high variance.

Balsa’s better generalization is due to a **broader state coverage** offered by simulation, **on-policy learning**, and safe exploration

the main point of this paper is to learn without expert demonstrations.

## Problems

Existing RL-based methods assume the availability of a mature query optimizer to learn from.

## Assumptions

the **database content is kept static**. 

Updates to the schema, appends, or in-place updates can be handled by retraining. 

This assumption implies that the agent need not solve a learning problem with a shifting distribution. Another assumption is that Balsa currently optimizes select-project-join (SPJ) blocks.

## Techniques

### Formulation

query optimization as an MDP:

- state: partial query plan.
- action step in building a query plan in a **bottom-up fashion**， either join two tables, or assign a scan method.
- a reward is given only at the final (terminal) state, each action only gets zero rewards

### Query Type

### Query Encoding

same as NEO

### Process

learn to optimize queries without learning from an existing expert optimizer

Simulation and reality phases:

- simulation phase trains a value network based on the simple **CE cost**, although this **CE cost** is not accurate, it enables the agent to avoid the worst plans.
- reality phase finetunes the value network.
- during exploration, Balsa generates several best-predicted plans (instead of the best) and then picks the best unseen one out of them.

Generalization:

- train with high diversity, merge experiences with several independently agent with different seeds.

Some techniques

- timeouts, 
- exploration only on the best few plans.
- on-policy learning better than retraining.

# 4. Is Your Learned Query Optimizer Behaving As You Expect? A Machine Learning Perspective

## Takeaways

A number of join is an irrelevant proxy for execution time.

GEQO is used for large join number queries, which can be disabled to fairly compare.

## Problems

The absence of a **unified reproducible framework** make it currently impossible to fairly compare the results of LQOs.

Many filter combinations result in the same selectivity. Hence, the model would potentially suffer from the mismatch between features and target variables and will only perform well if this inconsistency is mitigated.

## Assumptions



## Techniques

### Query Type & Query Encoding

All existing LQO are query-driven methods other than data-driven.

Encoding schema for a query should be both **expressive and robust**.

- roubust: unique 1-to-1 mapping between the feature variables and the latency or cost of a query and its given plan
- expressive: the encoding should clearly reflect both the global and local context.

Bao does not use talbes but only cardinalities and costs.

 => easier to retrain and schema-agnosticism.

 => not one-to-one mapping: different filters in a query has same cardinalities for the same table. ??

Bao deos not use query encoding => increases the probability of converging to a local optimum.

### Model

An architecture that chains the ML models like in HybridQO, where different target variables are served to different models in the ML pipeline

## Workloads

### Dataset

JOB and STACK

We do not use the STATS-CEB benchmark, as it was originally developed for **challenges** in cardinality estimation as opposed to end-to-end query optimization, which is the focus of this paper.

### Dynamic Workload

- Leave One Out Sampling.
- Random Sampling.
- Base Query Sampling.
- Covariate Shift on JOB



# 5. NEO

## Takeaways



## Problems

However, none demonstrate that their improved cardinality estimations actually lead to better query plans.

Furthermore, unlike **join order selection**, selecting **join operators** (e.g., hash join, merge join) and choosing **indexes** cannot be entirely reduced to cardinality estimation.

## Assumptions

existence of a Sample Workload consisting of queries representative of the user’s total workload 

existence of the underlying engine’s capabilities (i.e., exercising a representative set of operators).

## Techniques

end-to-end learning approach, including join order, index, and physical operator selection.

### Formulation

query optimization as an MDP:

- state: partial query plan.
- action step in building a query plan in a **bottom-up fashion**
- a reward is given only at the final (terminal) state, each action only gets zero rewards

### Query Type

### Query Encoding

Query level information (**join graph**) + plan level information (**join order**).

- query-level: 
  - treats the **join graph as an adjacency matrix** and only encodes the **upper triangular portion** into one dim vec.
  - column predicates vector: 1-hot, hist, row-vector. row vector is to represent each row as a sentence.
- plan-level 
  - plan as a tree, each node is a vector of size J+2R, J is a number of join types, and R is a number of relations. Each relation has two values: table use or not? scan type

### Model

Value Model (tree-convolution) to predict the final execution time for a **partial or complete plan**.

- value network does not predict the cost of a subplan, but rather the best possible latency achievable from an execution plan that includes a given subplan.

best-first search + value network => valuate iteration techniques to generate the final plan.

- init-state: every scan is unspecified and there are no joins.
- action: either (1) fusing together two roots with a join operator or (2) turning an unspecified scan into a table or index scan

- not greedily follow the suggestions of the value network.
- with bootstrapping (warm-ups), it can avoid sample inefficiency problem

retraining from scratch other than fine-tuning.

## Workloads.

### Datasets

### Dynamic Workload

# 6.Lero

## Takeaways

The hint set-based strategy has some intrinsic limitations

## Problems

existing methods are 

- unstable performance.
- high learning costs.
- slow model updating.

It is unncessary to estimate cost with model.

## Assumptions

We assume **constant resource budget per plan execution in this paper**

## Techniques

Plan explorer + model two-class classification.

### Formulation

pair-wise classification problem

### Query Type

### Query Encoding

each node in the tree: join method, scane method, cardinality, row wideth, table used. (No estimated costs)

### Model

Pre-train on the synthetic workloads based on the **estimated cost** in the postgresql.

- randomly generate a number of plans with different join orders and predicates on different tables, 
- randomly set the cardinality for each sub-plan of each plan and feed them into the native cost model (without executing the plans) to derive the estimated plan costs as labels.

Online training

- get the real execution latency and re-train the model.
- retrian every 100 queries on IMDB and STATS, every 30 queries on TPC-H and every 50 queries on TPC-DS.

## Workloads.

### Datasets

tpch, tpc-ds, stats, imdb.

### Dynamic Workload

“time series split” strategy, always evaluated on the new template.

# 7.LEON

## Takeaways

Theoretically, as long as the **cardinality estimations and the cost model** are accurate, this architecture obtains the optimal query plan

The db query optimizer can do transformation for logical expression, such as 

- unnest an in/exists subquery to a semi-join query.
- subquery pushing involves **evaluating a subquery earlier** in the execution process and "pushing" its results into the main query. This changes the order of operations to reduce computational cost or improve query performance.

Those rules cannot be used in ML-based method, and thus ML-basd method cannot conduct the plan enumeration completely.

DB can be extendend with new operators, while the ML-based model can only learn in trail-and-error manner.

cost model to initialize the model => cold start problem.

## Problems

ML-based methods learn domain-specifc knowledge in a data-driven manner. Thus, it suffers from the following two fundamental limitations:

- only for spj query and cannot handle complicated query.
- cold-start problem

Therefore, ML should aid the traiditonal query optimizer otherthan replacing it. And ML model should start from the traditional query optimizer. 

## Assumptions



## Techniques

start from current performance and self-adjust to a certain dataset or workload.

- cost estimation as a contextual parise-ranking problem.

- robust plan exploration strategy

  - a plan with a higher ranking position should be explored with a higher probability
  - learned optimizer should correct its errors that lead to sub-optimal query plans

  

### Formulation

formalizes query optimization as a contextual pair-wise plan ranking problem

### Query Type

### Query Encoding

logical properties: output cardinality and join graph of the sub query.

physical properties: plan tree and the physical property of the whole plan. Each node is one-hot encoding representing the physical operators and sort order.

### Model

Intra-equivalent set Model: estimate the cost for each plan and uncertainty.

Inter-equivalent set Model: it is used to prune the redundant search space.

## Workloads.

### Performance

# 8. BASE

## Takeaways

transfer the model pre-trained on the cost and then to the latency sounds promising.

learn a mapping from cost to latency sounds promising.

## Problems

The DBMS cost model can estimate the cost for an execution plan, which is expected to reflect the latency of the plan, but they are not positively correlated in practice

## Assumptions



## Techniques

Two stage RL-based framework.

Stage 1: fit RL to chose the operation with leatest cost.

Stage 2: transfer a **pre-trained policy based on the cost** to a **better policy** based on latency

leverage cost as a trade-off to increase training efficiency and then transfer the pre-trained model based on the cost to a new model that can adapt to latency signals

### Formulation

BASE formulates the procedure of locating and filling the gap between cost and latency as a variant of IRL.

### Query Type

SPJ

### Query Encoding

Same as NEO

### Model

In the 2nd stage, we use a calibrated reward function by applying a parameterized calibration function to the cost signals.

calibration function only makes the calibrated cost signals and the latency signals more correlated

# 9.Reinforcement Learning with Tree-LSTM for Join Order Selection

## Takeaways

This handle the schema change by using dynamic pooling to map anylengthh input to a fixed sized vector.

## Problems

Existing work

1. fixed-length feature vectors cannot capture the structural information of a join tree, which may produce poor join plans.
2. Moreover, it may also cause retraining the neural network when handling schema changes (e.g., adding tables/columns) or multialias table names that are common in SQL queries.

## Assumptions



## Techniques

Two stage RL-based framework.

Stage 1: pre-train the Deep Reinforcement Learning with cost,  

Stage 2: finetune the model with the latency.

### Formulation

BASE formulates the procedure of locating and filling the gap between 푟휙and 푟(푙 )as a variant of IRL.

### Query Type

SPJ

### Query Encoding

query  + data

- query: contains join information in a query.
  i.e., matrix to represent all join relation, then flatten into one vector. Then it applies FC to get the final representation
- columns: 
  - numertical value: vector of 4 value, if column is in join, is =? is>? is<?
  - string value: only use the selectivity information and get the column representions.
- table: concatenate all columns representions.
- join tree: use tree-LSTM to learn a representation.
  - combine both Child-Sum Tree-LSTM and N-ar Tree LSTM.

### Model

Representation: use a Tree-LSTM

RL: use DQN.

- cost training and latency tunning.
- not move target from cost to latecy directly, but instead treate them as multi task learning, where train two Q network but use the same input representation.

Handle the dynamic worklaod:

- use dynamic pooling to encoding any dynamic length query
- Adding columns also use dynamic pooling

# 11.Eraser: Eliminating Performance Regression on Learned Query Optimizer

## Takeaways

This is mainly focus on the dataset side other than model side, for any trained model, it filter the search spcae based on model performance to increate the effectiveness of the model.

## Problems

learned model has regression due to reasons like 

- inherent difficulty of the learning problem, 
- the low generalization ability of the prediction model on new data, 
- the under-fitting on training data due to insufficient training data, 
- loss of features, noisy labels and inappropriate model training methods.

## Assumptions

Learned model has low generalizatin ability, thus has big regression problem.

## Techniques

Two stage RL-based framework.

Stage 1: coarse-grained filter to remove highly risky plans 

- Insight: ML prediction model is likely to underperform due to encountering **unseen feature values**, therefore **unexpected plan space** into **subspaces** based on unseen feature values. this is like data labelling process.
- train a model to predict **precise** or **imprecise** of each subspace.

Stage 2: cluster plans in fine-grained manner, evalutes each cluster based on the prediction result.

- Cluster the remaining precise plans into groups based on their feature values and the model’s reliability.
- Assign each cluster a **reliability interval**

### Formulation

A performance elimination method perf_elim such that benefits are maximum and loss is minimized.

### Query Type

SPJ

### Query Encoding

plan-level features: join relations, filtering predicates and operator types

- join: join type, scan type,
- filter: low and high value
- relation: 0/1 to indicate existance.
- structure: use a categorical variable to indicates it, bushy tree, left-deep and right-deep, on plans joining 4 tables

data-level features: estimated cardinality and data distribution

### Model

unexpected plan explorer filter bad plans based on the **relability threshold.**

cluster the remining plans and use the **segment model**, and also assign **relability value** to reflect the quality.

Then filter again, and use **plan selection method** to balance the benefit of **improvements** and the **risk of regression**.

# 13.CardBench: A Benchmark for Learned Cardinality Estimation in Relational Databases

## Takeaways

learn from the transferable features, and not from the workload specific features such as table and attribute names.This approach enables learning of zero-shot CE models.

## Problems

Traditional CE techniques used in modern database systems have well-known limitations, as they **make simplistic data modeling assumptions, such as data uniformity and independence of columns in the tables**.

Learned CE have not been adapted in practice, due to their high training overheads.

## Techniques

zero-shot models are pre-trained on a **broad spectrum of different datasets** and use **transferable features (dataset-agnostic)**, such as table sizes, allowing them to generalize to unseen datasets.

### Query Type

## Problems



## Assumptions



## Techniques

**reward weighting** to reduce the **impact of previous poor operators** and make LOGER pay less attention to disastrous plans by log transformation.



### Formulation

state: subplan's join order and operator

action: join table and with restricted operator (disable a join algorithm, like disable hash join)

### Query Type

spj without sub-queries

### Query Encoding

Graph Transformer: GT not only efficiently captures relationships between table representations that include both table and predicate information, but also integrates global structural information of join graph into table representations.

- table: table-level learned embedding vector.
- column: column-level statistic vector with column type, proportion of unique values, unique value count, null values, index.
- predicts: join exist or not, selectivity (via approximation of DBMS cardinality estimator.)

# 15.Presto’s History-based Query Optimizer

## Takeaways

## Problems

learning based CE/cost method requires large trainng efforts, less robustness, and hard to debug.

## Techniques

HBO tracks q**uery execution statistics** at the operator node, and **uses those to predict future performance** for **similar** queries.

1. Similary query fetching: only record the template, 
2. HBO is more powerful than CBO as it can store various runtime statistics related to scheduling as well

- join reordering: HBO record the stats for some join order, and thus accurate. If not meet before, we use the CBO.

# 16.PARQO: Penalty-Aware Robust Plan Selection in Query Optimization

## Problems

Accurate estimation of the cardinality and cost comes at the cost of runtime monitoring and ongoing maintenance.

Therefore, how much influence of such uncertainty bring to the selectivity estimates still underexplored.

Robustness is tied to the uncertainty, and use the uncertainty in practise has challenges:
