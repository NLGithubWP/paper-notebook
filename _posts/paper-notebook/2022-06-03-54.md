# Introduction

## Motivation & Contributions

**The general idea of the paper is to capture the correlation of activations within a network when subject to different inputs within a minibatch of data the lower the correlation, the better the network is expected to perform as it can differentiate between different inputs well.**

The paper uses activations overlap between datapoints in untrained networks to measure the network's performance. 

The paper evaluates the algorithm on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, NATS-Bench, and Network Design Spaces.

# Evaluation

We are able to search for a network that achieves 92:81% accuracy in 30 seconds within the NAS-Bench-201 search space.



## Correlation of Accuracy & Score

These results point to our score being effective on a wide array of neural network design spaces.

## Study

1. How important are the images used to compute the score?

In the paper, we randomly select 10 architectures from different CIFAR-100 accuracy percentiles in NAS-Bench-201 and compute the score separately for 20 random CIFAR-100 mini-batches.

This suggests our score captures a property of the network architecture, rather than something data-specific.

2. Does the initialization influence the score?

better-performing networks remain distinctive and can be isolated

3. Does the size of the mini-batch matter?

The best-performing networks remain distinct.

4. How does the score evolve as networks are trained ?

We observe that the score increases in all cases immediately after some training has occurred.
