Latency prediction suffers from **unstable performance, high training cost, and slow model updating.**

### Solutions

Relative order or rank of execution plans, rather than the exact cost or latency is sufficient for query optimization.

- The classification task is much easier than the regression tasks.
- Non-intrusive design.



### Some Details

cardinality spans in wide range, it uses min-max normalization.

plan embedding model and comparator model are learned together.

Plan enumerator: it is tuned by changing cardinalities.
