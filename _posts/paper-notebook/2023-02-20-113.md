This paper present spark's open-source distributed machine learning library. 

Integrate ML with spark has benefits:

- Spark is designed with **iterative computation, which facilicate the ML algorithm in nature.** 
- Low-level components improvement has performance gain in MLLIB
- Simplify the deployment

Features:

- fast, distributed implementations of ML algorithms

- algorithmic optimizations to reduce JVM garbage collection, communication costs, 

- Pipeline API: It address the overhead of pipeline construction.
