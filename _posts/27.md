Viewstamped Replication Revisited

# Introduction

This paper presents an updated version of VR (`replication protocol` to handle a failure)

The new protocol in this paper is 

- Simpler and better performance
- Doesn't require disk usage; it uses replicated state to provide persistence. 
- The protocol can change the membership of group or group size
- Application dependent-free protocol.

# Background

## Assumption

No Byzantine failures.

Asynchronous network (message takes arbitrarily long to deliver, maybe lost, duplicated, delayed, out of order.)

## Replica Groups

Assume f node may not respond, f node may fail while at least one normal node process the request.

So the total node

```mathematica
 # node = f (no response) + f (fail) + 1(normal) = 2f+1
```

The system ensures reliability and availability when no more than f replicas are faulty 
when total replicas = 2f +1
